## Evidence policy

Use sources in this order:

1. Intel SDM, AMD APM, and installed WDK headers for architectural or DDI
   requirements.
2. Vendor optimization manuals for documented microarchitectural guidance.
3. Hardware measurements from the exact binary, CPU, and Windows build under
   discussion.
4. Research papers for design context only.

Every architectural claim must identify the document revision and section or
table title. Page numbers are secondary because pagination changes between
combined and split manuals. A clean build proves neither successful VM entry
nor correct behavior on untested hardware.

## Review rules

- Validate optional controls against capability MSRs or CPUID before use.
- Keep C layout assertions for every assembly-visible VMCS/VMCB context field.
- Add an exit handler before enabling a new intercept.
- Preserve all-CPU rollback, SLAT invalidation, and fail-stop teardown.
- Separate architectural requirements from project policy and measured facts.
- Record CPU model, firmware state, Windows build, configuration, service path,
  driver hash, sample count, and statistic for every performance result.
