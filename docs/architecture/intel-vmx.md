## Platform gates

The backend requires VMX, firmware-enabled `IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL`, valid VMX
fixed bits, EPT, a four-level WB EPT pointer, 2 MiB EPT pages, and INVEPT.
VMXON and VMCS regions receive the runtime revision identifier and are placed
below 4 GiB when `IA32_VMX_BASIC` requires it.

Control words are adjusted through their capability MSRs. VM entry and exit
save or restore debug controls, PAT, EFER, and 64-bit host state. Secondary
controls enable EPT and conditionally enable RDTSCP, VPID, INVPCID, and XSAVES.

## VMCS and exit pipeline

Each processor owns a VMXON region, VMCS, MSR bitmap, host stack, cached CPUID
policy, VPID, EPT views, exit history, and hypercall-page registration.

The VM-exit path:

1. Preserves guest GPRs and ABI-volatile XMM registers.
2. Reads the exit reason, qualification, instruction length, and guest state.
3. Restores a valid IDT-vectoring event.
4. Synchronizes the active EPT view generation.
5. Handles CPUID, control-register, MSR, VMX-instruction, EPT, and stop exits.
6. Advances RIP only for completed instruction emulation.
7. Restores state and executes `VMRESUME`.

Unknown exits and invalid transition states use distinct fail-stop signatures.

## NMI rendezvous and TSC compensation

Timing-sensitive exits use an epoch-counted VMX-root barrier. The owner sends
ICR-low `0x000C4400` through xAPIC MMIO offset `0x300` or x2APIC MSR `0x830`.
NMI exiting handles targets in VMX non-root mode; a registered Windows NMI
callback handles targets already in VMX-root mode.

CPUID, EPT violations, intercepted RDTSC/RDTSCP, and intercepted
`RDMSR(0x10)` are mandatory rendezvous exits. Control-register, other MSR,
GDTR/IDTR, and LDTR/TR exits are conditional during the eight-exit hook
window. External interrupts, MTF, and the VMX-preemption timer never start a
rendezvous.

Every participant prepares before any `VMCS_TSC_OFFSET` write. All processors
apply one common compensation delta and wait for one future resume TSC.
Acquisition and prepared-count timeouts fail open without compensation;
failures after offset application begins fail stop.

While the phase is `Claimed`, the owner drains old per-CPU join guards and, for
xAPIC, verifies ICR readiness before resetting the epoch and counters. It then
publishes `Acquiring`, arms new expected-epoch markers, and broadcasts. After
a real broadcast, an outstanding marker intentionally consumes the first later
NMI because delivery has no software epoch tag. The xAPIC preflight occurs
before marker arming, preventing a no-send failure from leaving stale markers.

## CPUID policy

CPUID exits are emulated. The policy hides VMX exposure, applies the enabled
INVPCID, XSAVES, and RDTSCP masks, and preserves native topology and
OS-dependent results. Release and Benchmark configurations can use the
assembly fast path when its EPT, event, debug, and code-segment guards pass.

## EPT and VPID

The identity EPT maps up to 512 GiB. RAM uses WB memory type and non-RAM uses
UC. Uniform ranges use 2 MiB leaves; mixed memory maps, per-page permissions,
and hook pages use 4 KiB page tables.

Each processor owns primary and secondary EPT views with independent
generation counters. Mapping changes increment the backend generation and
rendezvous active processors. The callback uses single-context INVEPT when the
CPU supports it and all-context INVEPT otherwise.

Per-CPU VPIDs start at one. INVVPID is used for emulated CR3 updates when VPID
is active.

## Execute hooks

`IntelHookInstall` validates the target GPA and patch range, prepares the
target page in every processor's primary and secondary views, copies the
original page into contiguous shadow memory, and applies the patch bytes.

The primary view keeps the original page readable and writable without execute
permission. The secondary view maps the shadow page execute-only. EPT
violations switch the active view and retry the guest instruction without RIP
advancement.

Hook policies are stored in a fixed slot table and GPA hash. Installation and
removal serialize mutations, rendezvous all active processors, restore original
PTEs on removal, retire secondary views, and reclaim per-CPU page-table pages
after lock-free readers have crossed an invalidation boundary.

`ObserveHookInstall` builds a trampoline for the displaced instructions and a
fixed-size thunk that enters `AsmHookDispatcher`. `HookObserveDispatch`
increments the hit counter, calls the registered callback, and returns the
trampoline address. Query and list operations expose the hook ID, GPA, cookie,
active state, and hit count.

## Control transport

`DriverEntry` reads `Parameters\HypercallSeed`, restricts the service and
parameters registry keys to SYSTEM and Administrators, and starts the
hypervisor.

The seed derives CPUID subleaves and command identifiers with FNV-1a. A client
registers one page on its selected processor. The worker locks that user page
with an MDL and services these commands:

- register shared page;
- install, remove, query, and list hooks;
- read and write memory;
- invoke the hook probe.

Process-exit notification releases registered pages. Hypervisor teardown stops
the worker, drains rundown protection, removes hooks, resets thunk storage, and
frees processor EPT views.

## Teardown and diagnostics

Before VMXOFF, the stop path captures current guest control, debug, descriptor,
PAT, EFER, SYSENTER, FS, and GS state. The assembly return path restores that
state after leaving VMX operation.

Debug builds retain bounded per-CPU VM-exit history. EPT violations, EPT
misconfigurations, event collisions, invalidations, and unexpected exits use
separate bugcheck signatures.
