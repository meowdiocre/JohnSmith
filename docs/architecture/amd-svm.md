## Required platform state

| Requirement | Project policy | APM location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SVM | Require `CPUID.80000001H:ECX.SVM` | SVM feature discovery |
| Firmware | Reject `VM_CR.SVMDIS=1` | `VM_CR` |
| SVM revision | Require nonzero `CPUID.8000000AH:EAX` | Section 15.4 |
| ASIDs | Require at least host ASID 0 and one guest ASID | `CPUID Fn8000_000A` |
| Nested paging | Require NPT | Section 15.25 |
| Next RIP | Require NRIPS | VMCB `nRIP` support |
| CET | Reject `CR4.CET=1` | Project safety policy |

Every assembly-visible VMCB field has a compile-time offset assertion. Required
SVM/VMCB features and guest-writable EFER enable bits are gated by AMD CPUID;
no VMCB field or clean bit is inferred from an Intel encoding.

## VMCB policy

The guest VMCB captures segment, control, debug, syscall, PAT, EFER, and
descriptor state. The backend enables:

- nested paging;
- MSR permission-map interception;
- CPUID interception with native-result feature masking;
- INVLPGA interception;
- SVM-instruction interception;
- XSETBV interception when XSAVE is present; requests currently receive `#GP` until guest XCR0 and host XCR0 are preserved separately.

The CPUID handler executes the requested native leaf/subleaf, clears hypervisor
and VMX exposure from leaf 1, clears SVM from `0x80000001`, and zeros the SVM
capability leaf `0x8000000A`. It advances to `NextRip` only after completing the
emulation. AMD bare-metal validation remains required.

I/O interception is disabled until the project owns an explicit port policy.
An allocated all-zero IOPM would add state without changing behavior.

## Entry and exit pipeline

`AmdAsmLaunch` saves the host VMCB, establishes a dedicated host stack, loads
guest state, enables GIF, and executes VMRUN. On exit it saves the guest VMCB,
restores the host VMCB, preserves GPRs and ABI-volatile XMM state, then calls the
C dispatcher.

The handler:

1. Consumes any pending NPT generation into `TLB_CONTROL`.
2. Restores valid `EXITINTINFO` into `EVENTINJ`.
3. Dispatches the exact exit code.
4. Advances to `nRIP` only for successfully emulated instructions.
5. Clears relevant VMCB clean state after software changes cached fields.

Unknown exits and unexpected nested page faults fail-stop with exit information
and RIP preserved for diagnosis.

## ASIDs and TLB invalidation

`CPUID Fn8000_000A.EBX` is an ASID count including reserved host ASID zero.
Valid guest ASIDs are `1..AsidCount-1`. Because each VMCB remains pinned to one
logical processor, numeric ASIDs need not be globally unique.

Live NPT changes increment a shared generation and execute an IPI rendezvous.
The callback uses a private signature-gated CPL0 VMMCALL rather than CPUID. The
exit handler observes the generation before dispatch and selects:

- `TLB_CONTROL=3` when flush-by-ASID is enumerated;
- `TLB_CONTROL=1` otherwise.

The ASID clean bit is cleared before VMRUN, and the post-rendezvous generation
check proves that every active CPU consumed the update.

## NPT

The identity NPT covers at most 512 GiB. Physical RAM and non-RAM cache flags
are derived from the active PAT. Fully uniform 2 MiB ranges use large entries;
mixed ranges are split into 4 KiB entries.

An NPF represents a second-level translation or permission failure, not a guest
page fault. JohnSmith has no recoverable NPF policy/emulator, so unexpected NPF
exits fail-stop with `EXITINFO1`, `EXITINFO2`, and RIP.

## Events and instruction policy

The handler will not overwrite a valid pending injection. A collision between
an event already selected for `EVENTINJ` and a new exception is a fail-stop
condition.

CPUID policy hides hypervisor, VMX, and SVM exposure while retaining native
topology and OS-dependent results. MSRPM policy virtualizes EFER, VM_CR, and
VM_HSAVE_PA while rejecting unsupported intercepted accesses with `#GP`. EFER
SCE, NXE, LMSLE, FFXSR, TCE, MCOMMIT, INTWB, UAIE, and AIBRSE writes are gated
by their documented CPUID fields. VM_CR writes enforce reserved-bit and
LOCK/SVMDIS semantics; VM_HSAVE_PA writes enforce alignment and physical-width
constraints.
Guest SVM instructions and INVLPGA receive `#UD`; nested SVM is not implemented.
XSETBV receives `#GP` until transition code owns separate host and guest XCR0.

## Host state and teardown

VMRUN/VMEXIT automatic state is supplemented by VMSAVE/VMLOAD for state not
covered by the automatic transition. Teardown reconstructs current Windows
control/debug state from the guest VMCB, restores PAT, EFER, and VM_HSAVE_PA,
reenables GIF, and returns to the captured `nRIP`/RSP.

## Speculation-control boundary

[AMD publication 111006-B](../../static/docs/111006-amd-hypervisor-speculation.pdf)
describes separate host and guest `SPEC_CTRL` behavior on VMRUN/VMEXIT for CPUs
that enumerate the facility. JohnSmith does not yet model the corresponding
VMCB state and makes no claim that this older paper applies to every supported
AMD CPU. Any future implementation must first verify current APM fields, CPUID
enumeration, and processor errata.

## Deliberate exclusions

- Nested SVM instructions are rejected rather than virtualized.
- I/O virtualization and a device model are absent.
- AMD CET/SSP state virtualization is absent.
- Recoverable NPF emulation and nested SVM are absent.
