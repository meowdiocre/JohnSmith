# EPT and runtime-control roadmap

Audited: **2026-07-13** against the current first-party source and
`JohnSmith.vcxproj`.

Status labels:

- **[IMPLEMENTED (code)]** — reachable, project-wired code exists. Hardware
  validation is a separate gate.
- **[PARTIAL]** — some code exists, but the full item is not implemented.
- **[NOT IMPLEMENTED]** — no end-to-end implementation was found.
- **[BLOCKED BY DEFECT]** — code exists but cannot safely provide the claim.
- **[NOT VERIFIED]** — the required test/hardware evidence is absent.

The concise cross-project audit and release blockers are in
[`implementation-status.md`](implementation-status.md). A stage is not complete
merely because one symbol or prototype exists.

## Findings that constrain the design

1. An EPT violation is not a guest page fault. Only an explicit policy may
   synthesize `#PF`, with a policy-derived PFEC and valid GLA.
2. Guest CR2 is not a VMCS field. The Intel slow path now snapshots/restores a
   per-vCPU `GuestCr2`, but no synthetic-`#PF` policy uses it yet.
3. Execute-only EPT is capability-dependent. Write-without-read remains
   unsupported by the current API.
4. One EPT cannot map one GPA to two HPAs simultaneously; dual-view hooks need
   separate EPT roots or EPTP switching.
5. Runtime split/query/set/merge primitives substantially exist, but their
   requested test matrix and bare-metal evidence do not.
6. EPT misconfiguration and unknown exits remain fail-stop until an exact
   recovery policy exists.
7. External-interrupt exiting is not requested. The checked-in one-slot
   interrupt/NMI window scaffold has no producer and is not a complete queue or
   NMI virtualization design.
8. XSS is not XCR0. Guest XSETBV is safely rejected on both backends; guest
   XCR0 virtualization is absent.
9. AMD CPUID is intercepted and emulated from native results. The policy clears
   hypervisor, VMX, and SVM exposure and zeros the SVM capability leaf. AMD
   hardware validation remains required.
10. Private host page tables require a mapping-lifetime design; a shallow PML4
    copy would not provide the claimed isolation.
11. Physical-memory IOCTL terminology must distinguish GPA, current HPA, and
    guest VA once remapping exists.

## Stage 0 — contracts, capability gates, and tests

1. **[PARTIAL]** Strong types exist for permissions and EPT roots, but GPA, HPA,
   and hook IDs still use generic integer/`PHYSICAL_ADDRESS` types.
2. **[NOT IMPLEMENTED]** The backend interface still contains hook operations,
   but both backend operation tables expose them as unsupported. The requested
   Intel-specific root/view separation is absent.
3. **[PARTIAL]** Hook installation follows hook-lock → root-lock order and
   rendezvous occurs after lock release. The contract is not encoded or tested.
4. **[BLOCKED BY DEFECT]** A force-primary rendezvous exists, but removal
   unpublishes policy before enabling it. The hook callbacks remain disabled.
5. **[PARTIAL]** Patch and SLAT address checks exist. Canonical GVA, page-walk,
   user-buffer, and physical-width coverage is incomplete.
6. **[PARTIAL]** EPT qualification decoding is factored into a helper. PFEC,
   DR qualification, event priority, and guest-walk helpers/tests are absent.
7. **[PARTIAL]** Architecture documents and pinned manuals exist, but this audit
   found source/document contradictions; citations and status must be reviewed
   with each policy change.

## Stage 1 — complete and harden the existing EPT primitives

Files: `src/intel/intel_slat.c`, `src/intel/intel_internal.h`,
`include/hv.h`, `src/introspection.c`.

1. **[PARTIAL]** `IntelSplit2MbLocked` exists, allocates before publication,
   clones PFNs, and preserves R/W/X plus memory type. Ignored/PAT,
   suppress-VE, and user-execute capability policy is not implemented.
2. **[IMPLEMENTED (code)]** Intel query, access mutation, and remap select the
   containing 4 KiB page from an arbitrary byte GPA. HPA remap targets remain
   page-aligned.
3. **[PARTIAL]** `IntelQueryOwnedPageAccess` handles large and split mappings.
   The requested boundary/out-of-range/runtime-split unit tests do not exist.
4. **[PARTIAL]** `IntelSetOwnedPageMapping` atomically updates PFN and access
   under the root lock, but it is Intel-internal, unused by a caller, and
   untested.
5. **[IMPLEMENTED (code)]** Mutation publishes under the root lock, releases
   it, increments the generation, performs the all-CPU rendezvous, and runs
   INVEPT. **[NOT VERIFIED]** on hardware.
6. **[IMPLEMENTED (code)]** `PERMISSION` splits merge only when all 512 PTEs
   are contiguous and identical in the attributes the implementation tracks;
   retirement occurs after invalidation. **[NOT VERIFIED]** by focused tests.
7. **[PARTIAL]** `MIXED_MEMORY_MAP`, `PERMISSION`, and `HOOK` reasons exist.
   There are no hook reference counts, and a region retagged `HOOK` is never
   retagged or merged after its last hook is removed.

Acceptance gate: **[NOT VERIFIED]**. The startup introspection exercise covers a
single permission change. There is no committed evidence for the complete
split/remap/merge, memory-type, X-only, or all-core mutation matrix.

## Stage 2 — classify EPT exits instead of globally injecting `#PF`

Files: `src/intel/intel_exit.c`, `src/intel/intel_internal.h`,
`include/intel.h`, `asm/intel.asm`.

1. **[PARTIAL]** `IntelDecodeEptViolation` decodes access/EPT/GLA flags and the
   handler reads GLA only when valid. Diagnostics do not provide the full
   requested structured log.
2. **[IMPLEMENTED (code)]** `IntelHookLookup` uses an even/odd sequence around
   slot mutation and accepts only stable snapshots. Removal keeps slot contents
   alive until every vCPU retires the secondary view.
3. **[PARTIAL]** Known hook transitions switch EPTP and retry without advancing
   RIP. Stage 4 safety defects prevent completion.
4. **[PARTIAL]** The slow assembly path snapshots/restores per-vCPU guest CR2,
   and injection constants exist. No intentional page-fault policy, PFEC
   builder, call to `IntelSetGuestCr2`, or `#PF` injection path exists.
5. **[IMPLEMENTED (code)]** Unknown EPT violations use the dedicated decoded
   fail-stop path.
6. **[PARTIAL]** EPT misconfiguration has a dedicated fail-stop signature with
   CPU/GPA/RIP. It does not dump EPTP or relevant walk entries as requested.

Acceptance gate: **[NOT VERIFIED]**. No focused tests demonstrate instruction
versus data classification, invalid-GLA handling, CR2 isolation, or retry RIP.

## Stage 3 — event and exit robustness, one reason at a time

1. **[PARTIAL]** Intel classifies vectors 0, 10-14, 20, and 21 according to SDM
   Table 7-4, promotes architectural double-fault pairs, and preserves the
   already restored event for serial pairs. Shutdown semantics,
   instruction-length cases, and hardware tests remain open.
2. **[NOT IMPLEMENTED]** Interrupt/NMI window injection has dead scaffold code,
   not a complete feature. No producer calls it. If the NMI request function
   were called, it could enable NMI-window exiting without NMI exiting and
   virtual NMIs.
3. **[IMPLEMENTED (code)]** Unknown exits remain fail-stop.
4. **[PARTIAL]** MOV-DR decode/emulation code exists for forced exits, but the
   intercept is not requested and host debug-register ownership is unproven.
5. **[PARTIAL]** RDTSC/RDTSCP fallback emulation exists; RDTSCP exposes host
   `TSC_AUX`. Normal controls do not request RDTSC exiting.
6. **[NOT IMPLEMENTED]** No defined or tested cross-core TSC synchronization
   policy exists.
7. **[PARTIAL]** Guest XSETBV is rejected with `#GP`, preventing host XCR0
   corruption. Guest XCR0/IA32_XSS virtualization is not implemented.

## Stage 4 — dual-EPT code hooks

Files: `src/intel/intel_hook.c`, `src/intel/intel_internal.h`,
`src/intel/intel_slat.c`, `src/intel/intel_exit.c`, `src/intel.c`.

1. **[PARTIAL]** `INTEL_EPT_ROOT` owns PML4/PDPT/PD/split-list/lock/EPTP
   metadata, and primary/secondary roots are separate. The requested reference
   counts are absent.
2. **[BLOCKED BY DEFECT]** The lazily allocated secondary root is a fresh
   identity R/W map, not a deep copy. It does not inherit or track primary
   remaps and permission changes.
3. **[BLOCKED BY DEFECT]** A cached contiguous shadow is patched from the HPA
   currently mapped by the primary root, but arbitrary RAM/MMIO targets and
   cache aliases are not rejected.
4. **[BLOCKED BY DEFECT]** Install forces the primary PTE to R/W and creates an
   executable shadow without proving that the original target policy allowed
   those accesses.
5. **[PARTIAL]** Transition branches retry without advancing RIP, but the
   subsystem is externally disabled until the view invariants are repaired.
6. **[PARTIAL]** Per-vCPU EPTP tracking and generation-based INVEPT exist, but
   concurrent all-core transitions have no focused evidence.
7. **[BLOCKED BY DEFECT]** Install changes PTEs before publishing policy.
   Removal unpublishes policy before setting force-primary. Both gaps allow a
   legitimate violation to reach fail-stop handling.

Acceptance gate: **[BLOCKED BY DEFECT]**. Intel backend hook callbacks remain
disabled. Re-enable only after policy synchronization, target validation,
transactional publication/removal, focused concurrency tests, and bare-metal
evidence.

## Stage 5 — AMD CPUID policy

1. **[IMPLEMENTED (code)]** CPUID interception has a matching dispatcher and
   native-result masking policy.
2. **[IMPLEMENTED (code)]** The handler clears hypervisor and VMX exposure from
   leaf 1, clears SVM from `0x80000001`, zeros `0x8000000A`, advances `NextRip`,
   and marks the VMCB dirty.
3. **[NOT VERIFIED]** Topology/OSXSAVE behavior and AMD hardware evidence remain
   absent.

## Stage 6 — device/API surface

1. **[IMPLEMENTED (code)]** The secure device, DOS link, create/close/cleanup
   and device-control dispatch, and failure/unload teardown exist.
2. **[PARTIAL]** The ABI uses fixed-width versioned headers, `METHOD_BUFFERED`,
   length checks, and a SYSTEM/Administrators SDDL. There is no explicit
   debug-privilege check; access is ACL-based.
3. **[PARTIAL]** Status and hook add/remove/query ABI definitions exist, but the
   hook backend is disabled. HPA, GPA, GVA, and translate commands do not exist.
4. **[NOT IMPLEMENTED]** No 4/5-level guest page-table walker exists.
5. **[NOT IMPLEMENTED]** No executable-write coherency or MMIO range policy
   exists. The disabled hook implementation already demonstrates why this
   policy is required before consuming arbitrary physical mappings.
6. **[IMPLEMENTED (code)]** IOCTL handlers acquire rundown protection before
   reading the published `HV_STATE*`. Unpublish blocks new requests and waits
   for in-flight handlers before hypervisor stop.
7. **[NOT IMPLEMENTED]** No user-facing VMCALL command ABI exists.

## Stage 7 — console

**[NOT IMPLEMENTED]** There is no `tools/johnsmithctl/` project. The existing
tool is only the VM-exit benchmark.

## Stage 8 — host page-table isolation research gate

**[NOT IMPLEMENTED]** The current VMCS host CR3 is `__readcr3()`. No private
root address space or mapping-lifetime implementation exists, and no private
host-address-space claim should be made.

## Recommended implementation order

1. Complete Stage 0 contracts and add unit-testable helpers/tests.
2. Harden Stage 1 remap/split/merge with focused tests.
3. Complete Stage 2 classified EPT policy only where hook policy needs it.
4. Keep Stage 4 disabled until its root synchronization, publication ordering,
   memory policy, and focused concurrent tests are complete.
5. Add Stage 6 memory APIs/walker only when a concrete consumer requires them.
6. Implement Stage 3 event features individually, enabling controls only with
   complete producers and handlers.
7. Treat Stage 8 as a separate security project.

## Hardware verification gates

All gates are currently **[NOT VERIFIED]** by committed, reproducible evidence.
For each completed stage, build Debug/Release/Benchmark and run WDK analysis.
Runtime records must include CPU model/microcode, Windows build, VMX/SVM
capabilities, artifact SHA-256, and debugger logs. Required bare-metal tests
include all-core launch/stop, repeated split/remap/merge, concurrent hook
install/remove, instruction/data behavior, invalidation completion on every
CPU, sleep/hotplug policy, and failure injection at each
allocation/publication boundary.
